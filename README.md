# Polynomial Regression:
Polynomial regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It is a special case of linear regrassion but in this method polynomial regression fits a non-linear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y.

# Why Polynomial Regression?
In the linear regression or the multiple linear regression the data the pretty much in linear which is not a very practical thing in the real world. 

Considering Real world examples the data might not be so linearly but more scattered. In such cases linear regression might not be the best way to describe the data. A curved or non linear line might be a better fit for such data.

## Some facts about Polynomial Regression:
1. In this regression, the relationship between dependent and the independent variable is modeled such that the dependent variable Y is an nth degree function of independent variable Y.
2. The polynomial regression fits into a non-linear relationship between the value of X and the value of Y.
3. The Polynomial regression is also called as multiple linear regression models.
4. The Polynomial regression model has been an important source for the development of regression analysis.
